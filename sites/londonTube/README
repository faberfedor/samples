This is a proof of concept for an art project thought up by my friend
Eric Kleptone. The idea is to replace the name of a tube (subway)
station with the most tweeted word about/around that station in
realtime. You can see this happening for a few of the stations.

To see the POC in action, go to http://faberfedor.com/londonTube/ and
give it 30 seconds or so.

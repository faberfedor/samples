"Always throw the prototype away & start over, because you will throw it
away eventually, and doing so early saves time and effort." -Brooks.

This is a little proof of concept idea, i.e. a prototype. I want to
create an website/app to do something like Uber does. Why? I'm
doing someone a favor.

This is not polished code. It's something I'm doing for fun.
don't judge my coding abilities until this thing is done, which it may
never be. If it does get finished, I'll throw it away as per Brooks.

To see this POC in action, go to http://faberfedor.com/gennady.
Click the "Sign in" button (ignore the user name and password"). 
This will take you to a Google Maps page. If you click the "Find Car Services".
you will be shown three car services near the beginning location (369 avenue y
brooklyn) which will take you to the destination (statue of liberty). Clicking
on the car service markers will show you the name, cost, etc.

This only works for Brooklyn and Somerville, NJ. Try typing in '1 East Main Street, 
Somerville, NJ" and "Grounds for Sculpture".

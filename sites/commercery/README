This is a proof of concept I put together for a freind's website.

It uses Twitter's Bootstrap to provide a responsive page.
To see it in action, go to the URL <a href="faberfedor.com/commercery">
http://faberfedor.com/commercery</a> on your desktop, tablet and/or 
smartphone.

Don't bother clicking through; it's just one page.

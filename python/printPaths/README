To print out terminal nodes 14 and 15 from the file treet2.txt: 

    python printPaths.py tree2.txt '[14, 15]'

To redirect the output to a file:

    python printPaths.py tree2.txt '[14, 15]' > output.txt

If you pass in a non-terminal node, a message saying that it's
not a terminal node will be printed and the next nodeId 
will be processed.
